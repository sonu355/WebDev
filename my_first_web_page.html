                    <p>3G CDMA is a combination of two specific technologies.
                        3G refers to the third generation of mobile telecommunications 
                        technology. 
                        It is the principle technology used for wireless voice and video 
                        calling over the Internet. 
                        The term 3G is generally associated with the speed of mobile transmission. 
                        Advances in the technology have led to newer versions, such as 4G and 5G.</p>

                    <p>CDMA, short for code division multiple access, is an access method used in 
                        telecommunication technologies. 
                        CDMA allows for higher and faster capacity for voice and data telecommunication 
                        that allows multiple transmitters 
                        to process and transmit information over one communication medium at the same time. 
                        Advances in this technology have led to the development of WCDMA, 
                        wide-band code division multiple access communication, which utilizes a 
                        wider range of frequencies, 
                        but is based on original CDMA technology.</p>
